# SynergyNet 3

SynergyNet is a java-based multi-touch interaction framework which utilises a large number of 3rd party libraries to facilitate additional features such as advanced network based communication.

SynergyNet 3 differs from [SynergyNet 2.5](https://github.com/synergynet/synergynet2.5) due to its wider range of features.
The framework is more stable than version 2.5 and offers support for advanced network abilities such as the use of web-based controls.  However, it is worth noting that [SynergyNet 3.1](https://github.com/synergynet/synergynet3.1), though similiar to the end user, is more streamlined and easier to develop with.
